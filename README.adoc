== Build Instructions

=== Running the App
This application can be run as a showcase using a published version of the AeroGear Js SDK, or as a development aid to working on the SDK.

==== Run Showcase
The `master` branch will always track to the latest release of the SDK.

To build the showcase app, run:
```
npm install
npm run ionic:build
```
You can choose to run the application on android or ios.
```
npm run ionic:android // to run in an android

npm run ionic:ios // to run in an ios
```

==== Troubleshooting
When running the application on both android or ios you will need to clean the projects root directory to remove conflicting files specific to each platform
This can be done by running the following:
```
npm run clean
```

If after running the application for iOS you get the following error: 
```
ld: library not found for -lGoogleToolboxForMac
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

run the following command from the root of the directory:
```
cd platforms/ios && pod install
```

and then re build the application.

==== Development and Contributing
Looking to use the showcase for development purposes with the SDK please take some time to read the link:./CONTRIBUTING.md[General Contributing Guide]
